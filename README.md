# Custom NLP Spam or Ham Classification Project

This repository contains code and resources for an NLP project focused on classifying messages as "spam" or "ham" using three different models: LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and a custom neural network. The project involves implementing NLP preprocessing techniques like lemmatization, stemming, and vectorization to prepare the data for the classification task.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to build and compare three different models for the task of spam or ham message classification. We will use the LSTM and Bi-LSTM models to leverage the sequential nature of the text data, and a custom neural network for a baseline comparison.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of labeled text messages, where each message is tagged as either "spam" or "ham." The dataset is split into a training set and a test set for model evaluation.


This project demonstrates the application of LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and a custom neural network for NLP-based spam or ham message classification. By comparing the results, we can identify the most effective model for this specific task.
